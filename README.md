# P2_WeatherConflictRPA

## Project Description

Marking events in your calendar is useful for keeping track of important events in your life. There are multiple factors that can impact these events. One important factor that may impact these events is weather. Bad weather that sneaks up on you can either ruin or hamper a planned event. While you can check the weather manually yourself, an advantage to RPA is that this can be done for you in order to notify you about weather that can impact your plans.
